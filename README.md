# Finetuning Large Language Models

Learning Outcomes:
- Fundamentals of finetuning a large language model (LLM).
- Understand how finetuning differs from prompt engineering, and when to use both.
- Practical experience with real data sets, and how to use techniques.
  * Prepare data for finetuning.
  * Train and evaluate an LLM on the data.
  * Select data to train the model, update the weights of the neural nets in the LLM, changing the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and RAG.
